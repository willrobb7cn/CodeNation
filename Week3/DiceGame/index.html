    <!-- <h4 align="center"> The rules of the game:
        The game has 2 players, playing in rounds <br>
        In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his current score<br>
        BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his current score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn<br>
        The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his current score gets added to his saved score. After that,
        it's the next player's turn<br>
        The first player to reach 100 points on saved score wins the game<br>
        BEWARE- if you roll two 6's in a row then you lose both your current score and your saved score...
